Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

include::{snippets}/orders/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

include::{snippets}/orders/http-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/orders/http-response.adoc[]

Response fields:
